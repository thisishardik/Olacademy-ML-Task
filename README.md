# Olcademy-ML-Task
This repository contains a recommendation engine and a customer segmentation analysis made using python as a part of the Olcademy task that was assigned.
Points to keep in mind:
1. Tasks done are : Task A and Task C 
2. The 'ratings_Electronics (1).csv' dataset used in the recommendation engine was not pushed to github as its size was greater than 300mb, surpassing the limit provided by Github.
